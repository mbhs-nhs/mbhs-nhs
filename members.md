# Important Announcement

We will be extending fall community service hours for all members.  Although many of you have already fulfilled your hours, you must submit at least 15 hours by January 12, 2018 to remain in good standing.  We are doing this because we didn’t get x2VOL running until a month or more into school, and didn’t have written guidelines for our hours.

# Etiquette for volunteering

* be polite
* you are representing NHS
* you are there to serve the community
* they are not there solely to provide you with hours
* be present and in the moment
* put away your phone while working
* establish a long-lasting connection with the community

# Service Hour Requirements

You must have **at least 5 hours within the community** and can have 10 within the school. As our guidelines state, you are allowed to get all of your hours outside of school, but must get at least 5 outside of school and no more than 10 within school.

Per our guidelines, any hours submitted for Peer Tutoring, PALS, Clinical Rotation, Early Childhood, Engineering or any other class for which you receive a grade will NOT count towards NHS community service hours. Hours affiliated with MBHS include work done for the school (outside of the school day) by helping teachers, PTO, helping  in  the  workroom, etc.

Hours associated with any group or club within MBHS will not be accepted if they are mandatory for that group or club or for a grade (if they are not mandatory, this will need to be verified by the group/club sponsor).

No volunteer hours can be earned during club meetings or club affairs unless organized as a service project.

No volunteer hours will be accepted if you are working at a sporting event for your team.

For a detailed document, please look at the full [service hour criteria](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WDhxRppl2GDg4XbHVJ07fj2Dk0hd-KiwGTzXXzFXaoY/edit?usp=sharing).

# Senior Graduation Stoles

Stoles will be handed out at the spring induction ceremony on May 2, 2018 to those seniors that have completed fall and spring hours prior to April 15.

Seniors must complete and submit all hours by May 1 to receive a stoll after May 15. We will announce specific days and times for those to be handed out.

# How to use x2VOL

x2VOL is a system to record, validate, and approve hours.

Please look at this [tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1KI7ecSQWUUa3BGTEp4WDJYZVU/view?usp=sharing).

You must thoroughly complete the description and reflection (these are not to be the same).

Hours that have not been verified by a supervisor are not being approved. After you have completed service hours for an organization, it is suggested that you send a follow-up email to your supervisor letting them know that they should be expecting an email from x2VOL.

You may use this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qjg-x6NxfpN9oAytj-7ZWk055LWlrWl3jflwxbBarw0/copy) for your emails.

# How to stay updated

The official commmunications will be through Remind. The Remind code is **@boydnhs17**

You should also ensure that you are on Ms. Smith's mailing list.

# National Honor Society: Future Ready

The National Honor Society wants to help members become #Futuready, that is, prepared for their bright futures. Take a look at their [resources](https://www.nhs.us/futuready). #Futuready is a collection of visual guides and videos especially for middle level and high school students. The series—custom-prepared for NHS and NJHS by an educator—provides guidance and exercises in building fundamental skills necessary for college, career, and lifetime success.
