# Active Partnerships

## Meals on Wheels: Collin County

Meals on Wheels is looking for volunteers. NHS members received a volunteer application that needs to be completed and emailed to mcandrewm@mowcc.com  It takes about 24 hours to process these and then they will send you a link to their SignUpGenius page to get them scheduled to volunteer.  We are working to get it put on the x2VOL site. 

## Volunteer McKinney

McKinney has a strong network of volunteers and volunteer opportunities. Visit [Volunteer McKinney's website](http://volunteermckinney.org/) for details.
